########## Provide a "brief" description of your project (and scope) ##########
We are creating a Lord of the Rings-themed CTF competition as practice for
ourselves and gain familiarity with CTF competitions. We plan to cover a few
eginner level CTF problems types, including cryptography, steganography, and 
web exploits. Participants will need to use a variety of tools and skills to
finish. We plan to tie the problems into the plot of either The Hobbit or Lord
of the Rings to make it more enjoyable and cohesive.

########################### Project Progress/status ###########################
We implemented a CTFd site and explored some of its functionality. CTFd allows
for "hidden" challenges that depend on solving other challenges, so we can
create a progressive challenge.

We explored how to set up SQL and pwnable/binary style challenges.

################# Updated/marked timeline/project plan/chart #################
Completed:
Determine framework and research how to create a CTF challenge.
CTF overview meeting to discuss range/difficulty/number of questions.
Finishing touches and setting up CTFd platform.

On-going:
Challenge research and writeups. (4/05-4/13)
Completing writeups for all problems. (4/05-4/13)

Future:
Submit. (4/14)


##### Any changes since proposal (and how those change the project/scope) #####
We scaled back on the variety of challenge difficulty because the difficulty
in programing/implementing and solving. Also we decided to not release this
to the class.
