########## Provide a "brief" description of your project (and scope) ##########
We are creating a Lord of the Rings-themed CTF competition as practice for
the class. We plan to cover a range of commonly occurring CTF problem types,
including cryptography, steganography, and web exploits. Participants will
need to use a variety of tools and skills to finish. We will be determining
the exact set of problems at our upcoming meeting. We plan to tie the problems
into the plot of either The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings to make it more
enjoyable and cohesive.


########################### Project Progress/status ###########################
We gathered resources on making and solving CTF challenges and examined them
for ideas and techniques. We have also began to discuss what types of problems
we want to include. We may use a platform such as CTFd to host our challenge.


################# Updated/marked timeline/project plan/chart #################
Determine framework and research how to create a CTF challenge. (3/30) COMPLETE
CTF overview meeting to discuss range/difficulty/number of questions. (4/01)
Challenge research and writeups. (4/01-4/14)
	-Completing majority of coding work. (4/01-4/07)
		-Pacing: approx. one problem per day?
	-Finishing touches and setting up CTFd platform. (4/08-4/10)
	-Completing writeups for all problems. (4/11-4/13)
Publishing CTF for the class. (4/14)


##### Any changes since proposal (and how those change the project/scope) #####
We may make our CTF a single, multi-stage challenge so that it feels more
"quest-like" and forces a certain order of completion, which would allow it to
follow a plotline. Regardless, it will include a variety of security-related
tasks that commonly appear in CTFs.
