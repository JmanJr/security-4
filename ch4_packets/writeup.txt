  Upon downloading the file, it is shown to be a .pcap (a packet capture file). In order to inspect the packets captured, wireshark 
can be used to view them in more detail.
  Upon opening the .pcap with wireshark, the traffic can be viewed in more detail. By going through the packets, you can eventually view an 
message asking for a key. The next message that contains human readable content contains the key. Another message says to wait for
a file transfer, and then eventually you can see a data transfer containing flag.txt.
  You can export the contents of the message containing the key, and the data transfer message. The message containing the key is 
just an ASCII file containing the raw text for the key. The second is a zip that contains flag.txt. The flag.txt file cannot be unzipped 
without a password, which is just the key from the first file. Flag.txt contains the flag.
