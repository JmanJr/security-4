  The start to the challenge is just a downloaded .jpg file. By running it through a steganographic decoder, 
a message is revealed that is part encrypted and part plaintext.

  By looking at the plaintext (which contains the number 64) and viewing the contents of the encrypted text 
(containing chars like '='), you can conclude that the encrypted message is in Base64. By running the encrypted 
message through a Base64 decoder, another encoded message appears.

  This message has punctuation which appears to follow English sentence structure, hinting that the encryption technique 
does not affect punctuation and is a replacement encryption algorithm. By testing a few types, it can be found to be a Caesar Cipher. 
Another English message is shown, with two lines of encrypted text.

  By taking the clue from the message (the reuse of the word pad), and the hint that the two lines are two seperate messages, 
you can infer that the encryption scheme is a reused pad. By cracking using crib dragging on the two messages, you 
can find the key used to be ONE_RING_BAD_LOL. This is the flag, in the format lotrflag{ONE_RING_BAD_LOL}.
